description:
 This check monitors the health status of individual components from public
 Atlassian Statuspage instances. Atlassian Statuspage is a hosted status page
 service used by companies to communicate service availability and incidents
 to their users via public web interfaces.

 The check processes data collected by the {Atlassian Statuspage} special agent,
 which queries the statuspage's public API. No agent installation is required
 on the target system as the data is retrieved via HTTP API calls.

 Each component's operational status is evaluated and mapped to Checkmk monitoring
 states based on configurable parameters:

 - {operational}: Component is fully functional (default: {OK})

 - {degraded_performance}: Component experiences performance issues (default: {WARN})

 - {partial_outage}: Component is partially unavailable (default: {CRIT})

 - {major_outage}: Component is completely unavailable (default: {CRIT})

 Unknown or undefined status values result in {UNKNOWN} state.

 The service displays the component's current status in the summary and provides
 additional details including the statuspage URL and component description.

 Prerequisites: Configure the {Atlassian Statuspage} special agent with the
 target statuspage URL to enable data collection.

item:
 The name of the statuspage component as reported by the Atlassian Statuspage API.
 Component names are typically descriptive service identifiers like "API Gateway",
 "User Authentication", or "File Storage".

discovery:
 One service is created automatically for each component found on the configured
 Atlassian statuspage. Services are named "Health {component_name}" where
 {component_name} is the exact component name from the statuspage.
