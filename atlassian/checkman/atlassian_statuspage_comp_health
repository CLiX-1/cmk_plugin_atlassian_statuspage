description:
 This check monitors the health status of individual components from an Atlassian
 Statuspage. It processes data collected by the {Atlassian Statuspage} special agent.

 The check evaluates each component's status and maps it to monitoring states
 based on configurable thresholds:

 {operational}: Component is fully functional (default: {OK})

 {degraded_performance}: Component has performance issues (default: {WARN})

 {partial_outage}: Component is partially unavailable (default: {CRIT})

 {major_outage}: Component is completely unavailable (default: {CRIT})

 If a component reports an unknown or undefined status, the service state
 will be {UNKNOWN}.

 You must configure the {Atlassian Statuspage} special agent to collect
 the component data from your statuspage.

item:
 The name of the Atlassian statuspage component as reported by the statuspage API.

discovery:
 One service is created for each component found on the monitored Atlassian
 statuspage. The service name follows the pattern "Health {component_name}".
